  "about": "Welcome to my resume website. I made this website myself at home and in school practice. It will be hosted on my server that I have at home. My server runs Unraid, which is an incredibly good operating system based on Debian. On my server I run Nextcloud, jellyfin, website hosting and a password manager. I'm a big fan of hosting my own services and keeping my own data. I not only find programming fun, but also have an interest in all kinds of IT. My most used programming language is C# which I have used in WPF, Unity, ASP.net and console applications. I am happy to do many different kinds of projects. It contains websites, console apps, games and WPF. I hope you will like my website. This website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL."
